### About

This project is intended as a replacement for the [Mozilla WebVTT](https://github.com/mozilla/webvtt/)
library.

The general goals of the project are to A) include support for the TTML
specification, and B) to improve API usability for WebVTT.

This library includes libexpat, though support for alternative XML
libraries, though support for alternative XML libraries such as
[PugiXML](http://pugixml.org/) may be added later on, for certain use-cases. As the primary
use-case is use within a browser, stream parsing is a nice thing to
have.

### API Reference
I'm sorry, there will be more of this later on :( Just let me hack on
this for a while okay? Okay, cool.
