This is my new mop!

00:04.220-->00:07.500
George, my friend, he gave me this mop!

00:07.300-->00:12.050
It's a pretty good mop!
It's not as good as my first mop.
I miss my first mop.

00:12.200-->00:14.050
But this is still a good mop!

00:15.020-->00:17.100
Sometimes ya hafta take what life <b>gives</b> ya

00:18.000-->00:20.000
'cause <b>life is like a mop!</b>

00:20.100-->00:26.200
And sometimes life gets full of <i>dirt</i> and <i>crud</i> and <i>bugs</i> and <i>hairballs</i> and stuff

00:26.300-->00:29.000
You.. You gotta <b>clean</b> it <b>out!</b>

00:29.000-->00:33.500
You, you gotta put it in here and rinse it off and start all over again and

00:33.500-->00:39.500
and sometimes life <i>sticks to the floor so bad</i> you know a mop, a mop it's not <b>good enough</b>

00:39.900-->00:42.900
It's not good <b>enough!</b>
You gotta get down there, like, with a <i>toothbrush</i>, ya know

00:43.000-->00:46.500
And you gotta, you gotta really scrub 'cause you gotta get it off.

00:46.500-->00:48.000
You gotta really try to get it off.

00:48.000-->00:51.050
But if that doesn't work, that doesn't work, you can't give up.

00:51.060-->00:53.300
You gotta, you gotta stand right up.

00:53.350-->00:55.070
You gotta run to a window and say,

00:55.070-->01:00.000
"Hey! These floors are dirty as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore!"

01:00.500-->01:08.100
