# Usage:
# Comments begin with '#' (Empty lines are ignored)
# Lines not prefixed with '!' are tools to import.
# Tools can be full-paths or names (for the --tools=... argument)
# Multiple tools can be specified on a single line, but should not
# end with a comma (Commas are automatically inserted by update-waf.sh)
#
# If a prelude is needed, it can be specified
# here by prefixing the appropriate line with '!'
# eg:
#!	from waflib.extras import foo
#!	foo.func()
#
